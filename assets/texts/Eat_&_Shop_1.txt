Among our offerings, you'll find specially curated collections such as our exclusive Balmoral Hunting Tartan and Balmoral Tweed ranges, which showcase exceptional craftsmanship and the sustainable use of locally sourced, British-made materials.

Our Mews Gift Shop is centrally located and easy to find upon entrance or exit of the grounds, opposite our newly-refurbished restaurant and next door to the central offices. The building was built in 1857 as a standing stable, with the garages to the right of the courtyard being used to store the open and closed carriages, dog carts and pony traps used by Queen Victoria and her family.
